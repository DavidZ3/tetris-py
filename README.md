# tetris-py
This project is my first time using the pygame module and is my goals for this project is to get a better understanding of python and the pygame module. 
Furthermore, I will be doing this project with zero reference to other tetris projects in order to come up with a unique implementation.
This has resulted in many changes in the program's design as well as some aspects of poor design. After this project I plan on refactoring the project 
to improve the overall design.
Afterward I may try a different project with pygame or try to write the same game with better code design in C++ and optimise for performance.
